# Fungal communities shift with plant parasitic nematode abundance in soils 

This repository contains the code for the analysis in:

Medina LÃ³pez, M., Lopez-Nicora, H.D., Benitez Ponce, M.S., 2024, Fungal communities shift with plant parasitic nematode abundance in soils. 

## Usage 
- Raw sequence files can be found in NCBI SRA under Project PRJNA1055501.  
- If using the raw sequences to reproduce the analysis, first process them with ITSxpress (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.15704.1) to extract the full ITS region.
